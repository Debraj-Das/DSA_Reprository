/ My Competitive course Contains

# In Competitive programming, We emphasize on Mathematic , Data Structures(for accurace and fast use STL , Graph) , Algorithm(very know and populare , some Advence)

$ Commonly use the Mathematic part is -> Combinator , Set and relation , static and probabily , Algebra , Game Theory , some Advanced Mathematic part

$ Data Structures -> Graph(VVI) and other Common one (but generally it used STL for Common one)

$ Algorithm -> For Data Structures associated Algorithm(we use Stl Algorithm header file) but other then Algorithm are use like Greedy , Recursion and Backtracking , Divide and Conquer, Dynamic programming , some Advence Algorithm
